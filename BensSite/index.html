		<h1>About me</h1>
		<img src="img/me.jpeg" alt="me" id="me"/><p>Hello! I'm Benjamin Hugo, an honours student in
		the Department of Computer Science at the University of Cape Town. This is the home of my
		section of our honours project. I will keep you up to speed on any developments through the 
		news portal. I'm part of a three man team investigating compression of the Radio Astronomy Data
		produced by the KAT-7 array. It is our hope that this research will form a good starting point for the
		future toolsets addressing the big-data storage requirements of the MeerKAT project.</p>

		<h1>Overview</h1>
		<p>I will be investigating a predictive compression scheme. In such a scheme the streaming data is divided into chunks which can be
		processed in parallel. The goal is to divide the data in such a way as to exploit dimensional coherency (lets say compressing the values
		of a particular frequency over several time steps). Since the values will likely not change much (or change relatively slowly over the
		duration of several steps) the prediction scheme may yield accurate predictions of consequtive values. If this is the case the difference
		between both mantisa bits and exponent bits of the predicted value and the actual value will result in many leading zero bits, which can 
		be stored in compressed form (saving the residual bits in uncompressed form). Such a scheme is simple and fast (see my paper litterature survey)
		and is ideal for scenarios where throughput enjoys preference over good compression ratios.</p>
		<p>I will be implementing both an optimised CPU version (using both a vectorised instruction set when ever possible, as well as being
		multithreaded) and a GPU version of the code if time permits.</p>
