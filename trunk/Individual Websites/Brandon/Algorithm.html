					Huffman Coding is a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_encoding">Entropy Coding algorithm</a>.
					<br>
					It compresses a file by changing all values in the file into shorter representations of each of those values, in such a way that is is reversable.
					<br>
					In order to find out the values to change each value in the data file, it finds all unique values in
					 the file and allocates a new value to that unique value. It allocates shorter new values
					 for vlaues that occur most often in the file. It the generates a table to show what each unique
					 value in the file is replaces to. The program also has to save this table to the file in order for 
					 the process to be reversable. 
				</p>
				<h2 class="h-text-2">Adaptive Huffman Coding</h2>
				<p class="text-1">
					Adaptive Huffman coding is very similar to normal Huffman Coding:
					<br>
					It allows for the algorithm to work for streaming data, data that it cant read the entire file for the unique values. 
					This is done by keeping a data set of all unique values, how many times they have been seen already, the initial code 
					given to that value, and the current code given to the value. This allows you to recompute the codes for all the 
					unique values each step, to make sure you are using the correct value at each step.
					<br>
					The storage is also slightly different, you save the initial codes given to each value, and in the order they were 
					created. And each replacement is stored as the code it was when the algorithm saw that value. This allows the decompression 
					algorithm to do the same steps as the compression algorithm did to change back to the origional data.
