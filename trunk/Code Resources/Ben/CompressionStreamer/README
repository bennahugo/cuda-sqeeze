COMPILE:
Ensure cmake is installed
create a directory "CompressionStreamer/build
cd to build
now type cmake ../
cmake will find required packages and generate a make file
now type make
the project should be compiled: run it using the path to the MeerKAT h5 file, check main.cpp for other flags

P.S to run with a different version of the compressor/decompressor you need to change the library
build target in Compressor/CMakeLists.txt
P.S if you want SSE + XOP support you will simply need to uncomment the line in Compressor/CMakeLists.txt
